Ben worked with us on a project called "CaseSilent" which is an app for control of your CPU fan speed from your smart phone or other device. He designed a really good app with our API. The application was designed to eradicate noisy desktops for good in the workplace. Ben managed to create a simple but effective solution which involved some software<span class="readMoreEllipsis">...</span> <span class="readMoreContinued">
                      that completely stopped the fans from spinning. Granted, it resulted in 17 test computers overheating and 56 melted front-panel connectors but it is really the results that count. Would highly recommend!
